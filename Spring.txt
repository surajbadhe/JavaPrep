What is Spring Security and its Methods?
Diff between IOC and DI?
Dependency Injection
	IoC is a design paradigm with the goal of giving more control to the targeted components of your application, the ones getting the work done. While Dependency injection is a pattern used to create instances of objects that other objects rely on without knowing at compile time which class will be used to provide that functionality.

Type of container Spring Container 
What are the different scopes of spring bean?
	Singleton : It returns a single bean instance per Spring IoC container.This single instance is stored in a cache of such singleton beans, and all subsequent requests and references for that named bean return the cached object.If no bean scope is specified in bean configuration file, default to singleton.

	Prototype : It returns a new bean instance each time when requested. It does not store any cache version like singleton.

	Request : It returns a single bean instance per HTTP request.

	Session : It returns a single bean instance per HTTP session (User level session).

	GlobalSession : It returns a single bean instance per global HTTP session. It is only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext (Application level session).

Spring-boot-starter-parents?
	The spring-boot-starter-parent is a special starter that provides useful Maven defaults. It also provides a dependency-management section so that you can omit version tags for “blessed” dependencies.

What is Spring boot starter?
	Starters are a set of dependency descriptors that you can include in your application.If you want to develop a web application or an application to expose restful services,
	We dont need to specify the dependency version in Sb.
	
	spring-boot-starter-web	It is used for building the web application, including RESTful applications using Spring MVC. It uses Tomcat as the default embedded container.
	spring-boot-starter-jdbc	It is used for JDBC with the Tomcat JDBC connection pool.
	spring-boot-starter-data-jpa	It is used for Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
	spring-boot-starter-security	It is used for Spring Security.
	spring-boot-starter-aop	It is used for aspect-oriented programming with Spring AOP and AspectJ.
	spring-boot-starter-test	It is used to test Spring Boot applications with libraries, including JUnit, Hamcrest, and Mockito.
	spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf	It is used to build MVC web applications using Thymeleaf views.
Differance JPA and Hibernate ?
	What Is the Difference Between Hibernate and Spring Data JPA? Hibernate is a JPA implementation, while Spring Data JPA is a JPA Data Access Abstraction. ... Hibernate provides a reference implementation of the Java Persistence API that makes it a great choice as an ORM tool with benefits of loose coupling.

what is the use of @Component, @service, @repository annotation ?
Uses of Spring Boot annotation -  
	@Component, @Service, @Repository and @Controller annotations are used for automatic bean detection using classpath scan in Spring framework.
	Spring automatically scans and identifies all these classes that are annotated with below annotation.
	@Component - @Component is a generic annotation used across application.
	@Controller -  annotate classes at presentation layers level, mainly used in Spring MVC.
	@Service - marks a Java class that performs some service, such as executing business logic, performing calculations, and calling external APIs. 
	@Repository - annotate classes at persistence layer, which will act as database repository.
		
	@Autowired 
	@Qualifier 
	@controller 
	@RequestMapping 
	@ConditionalOnMissingBean - Auto configuration to back off when bean exist
What is the use of @EnableAutoCongiguration?
	Automatic configuration features of the Spring Boot application, which automatically configures things if certain classes are present in classpath
	Spring Boot 1.0
	The @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation allows you to selectively exclude certain classes from auto-configuration using exclude attribute as shown below:

	@Configuration
	@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
	public class MyConfiguration {
	  //.. Java code
	}
What is the use of @SpringbootApplication? 
	Spring Boot 1.2 
	It's actually a combination of three annotations:
		@Configuration, which is used in Java-based configuration on Spring framework, 
		@ComponentScan to enable component scanning of components you write like @Controller classes.
		@EnableAutoConfgiuration itself, which is used to allow for auto-configuration in Spring Boot application.
	@SpringBootApplication does three things, it allows you to run the Main class as a JAR with an embedded container. It enables Java configuration, and it also enables Component Scanning.

What if we remove @SpringbootApplication for class ? will it still behave has spring boot application 
Types of configuration files used in springboot.
Difference between YAML(.yml) and .properties file in Java SpringBoot?
	Configurations properties required to make the application up and run like to connect with the database what are the credentials, on which port the application will run, etc.
	By using two ways we can load tha yaml file.
		YamlMapFactoryBean load as map
		YamlPropertiesFactoryBean load as properties
How to register custom auto-configuration?
	Mentioned fully qualified name under @EnableAutoConfgiuration KEY META-INF/spring.factory file
Profile Specific configuration 
	Dev - application-dev.properties 
	Prod - application-prod.properties 
	
	While running application pass 
		-Dspring-profile.active=prod 
	or you can use 
		spring-profile.active=prod in application.properties
