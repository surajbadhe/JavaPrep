1) Find the pair of integers in an array whose sum is x.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[]  arr= {1,3,5,4,2,3,1};
		int sum=6;
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			for(int j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++) {
				
				if(arr[i]+arr[j]==sum) {
					System.out.println(arr[i]+""+""+arr[j] +"---Sum"+(arr[i]+arr[j])); 
				}
			}
		}
